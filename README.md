# Test && Commit || Revert (TCR) with PHP
This repository contains all the code for The Engineering Coach YouTube video, "Test && Commit || Revert: A New Way to do TDD (PHP)".

This project serves as a practical demonstration of Test && Commit || Revert (TCR), an automated workflow that challenges the traditional TDD cycle. TCR is a powerful discipline that helps you work in incredibly small, safe steps by automatically committing your changes when tests pass and reverting them when they fail.

## What You'll Learn
  - The core principle of Test && Commit || Revert.
  - How to set up a TCR workflow for your PHP projects.
  - The benefits of this practice for building confidence and eliminating fear.
  - How TCR encourages a truly disciplined approach to TDD.
